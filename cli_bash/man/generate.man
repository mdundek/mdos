NAME
   [38;5;202m build-deploy [0m- Build local project & (re)deploy components to K3S.

SYNOPSIS
    osp build-deploy [38;5;247m[--component | -c <comp>][0m

DESCRIPTION
    This command will build the docker images based on your local project repos, deploy them to your
    local registry and kill the existing Pod in Kubernetes to force it to reload the container with the
    new image you just build.
    This command only works for components that are already running in the cluster. If you did not
    deploy the target component(s) beforehand to your K3S cluster, you will have to do so first.
